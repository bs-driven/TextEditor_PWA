### MOTIVATION
The motivation behind thos project was to create notes or code snippets with or without internet access. In order to be retrived for later use
### PROBLEMS
Well I'm not even sure how to put my problems into words really I guess this one assignment I've been given that I couldn't fully understand.
I can follow the steps that I must and even write out the code. 
But any problem that I run into I'm just not sure to fix it.
For instance I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong when it comes to the install feature on this app
### WHAT I LEARNED
Truthfully with one Ilearned I have along way to go and need to go back over the lessons I took on PWA's.
Honestly I feel like I looked over something small and just can't figure it out.This is one instance in which I'd seeked helped and been able to talk thing through while working through it
